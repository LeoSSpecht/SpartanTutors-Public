# What is this app?
This app was created to solve a clear problem, scheduling tutoring sessions between students and tutors. The objective was to make the app as simple
as possible, so users could book a session with few clicks.

# How I built it?
The app is almost entirely coded in Swift, apple's framework for iOS apps, learned specifically for this project.

The app uses Firebase to host all of the data, and firebase functions to handle part of the back-end like email messaging for confirmed sessions.

# What I learned

Wow so much.

Firstly I learned that even simply things, like making a calendar may be easy to look at, but it needs a lot of code to make it work, 
and even more code to handle all the possible edge cases

Also, it is incredible how visual aspects can dramatically change the user experience and make an app so much easier to do, and how simple things
like colors, animations and spacing can make a huge difference on the UX.

Lastly, how it is important to make it good, complete but also very simple, the least clicks the better. No one wants to make a thousand clicks just to book a 
private tutoring session.

# Can I use the app?
Yes for sure! Unfortunately it is only for iOS, but we are currently working on the Android one.
